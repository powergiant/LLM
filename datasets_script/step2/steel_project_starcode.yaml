export_in_parallel: false                                   # whether to export the result dataset in parallel to a single file, which usually takes less time. It only works when export_shard_size is 0, and its default number of processes is the same as the argument np. **Notice**: If it's True, sometimes exporting in parallel might require much more time due to the IO blocking, especially for very large datasets. When this happens, False is a better choice, although it takes more time.

op_fusion: true                                            # whether to fuse operators that share the same intermediate variables automatically. Op fusion might reduce the memory requirements slightly but speed up the whole process.

If this parameter is None, the cache file will not be compressed. We recommend you turn on this argument when your input dataset is larger than tens of GB and your disk space is not enough.
